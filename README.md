# Computational Multi-Physics Research Group (CMPRG)

This is the official website of the **Computational Multi-Physics Research Group (CMPRG)**.

We focus on developing computational tools for simulating **multi-material**, **multi-phase** systems across **multiple scales and physics**, with applications ranging from **bio-inspired flows** to **energetic materials** under extreme conditions.

This repository hosts the source code for our groupâ€™s website, built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
